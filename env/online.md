# OpenShift Online

Each of the following environment has integration, staging, and production cluster.

* [openshift.com](https://www.openshift.com/): clusters are usually deployed in different
regions in AWS.

    * online starter: free for developers with limited resources.
    * online pro: [pricing](https://www.openshift.com/pricing/index.html)
    * online dedicated: enterprise usage which could be deployed in Azure or GCE as well.

    From SVT respective, focus for now is starter and pro, mostly with integration and staging cluster.


* [openshift.io](https://openshift.io/): free for developers with limited resources,
similar to online starter.

    *It seems that .io links to starter of .com*
