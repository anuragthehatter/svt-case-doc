# Routine

## print cluster info

```sh
# ./svt/utils/scripts/print_test_env.sh
```

## cluster
Prepare the openshift cluster against which we run tests. The following [systemctl services](http://playbooks-rhtconsulting.rhcloud.com/playbooks/installation/admin_overview.html) should be running:

* docker
* openvswitch
* etcd
* atomic-openshift-node
* atomic-openshift-master, OR atomic-openshift-master-api and atomic-openshift-master-controllers on HA Configuration

I _believe_ that kubelet service is replaced by atomic-openshift-node in the context of openshift.

## pbench
Use pbench to collect system stats in case of troubleshooting.

## tests
Run either by Ansible or by bash. While running, monitor

- *fail* builds and *error* pod
- *error* system log <code>tail -f /var/log/messages | grep -i "error"</code>, or use <code>journalctl</code> command.

## logs
Collect logs (service logs, pod logs and events) generated by the tests. 

- Compare the data in logs with last release if no error occurred.
- Justify errors if any.
- Search among reported bugs, or create a new bug.

## system stats

- [pbench](pbench.md)
- EC2 console
