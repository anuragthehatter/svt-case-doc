## cluster
Prepare the openshift cluster against which we run tests.

## pbench
Use pbench to collect system stats in case of troubleshooting.

## tests
Run either by Ansible or by bash. While running, monitor

- *fail* builds and *error* pod
- *error* system log <code>tail -f /var/log/messages | grep -i "error"</code>

## logs
Collect logs generated by the tests. 

- Compare the data in logs with last release if no error occurred.
- Justify errors if any.
- Search among reported bugs, or create a new bug.

## system stats

- [pbench](pbench.md)
- EC2 console
