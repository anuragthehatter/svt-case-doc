## Practice stateful app in OC cluster
Run the following command if we use examples () from the above k8s doc:

```sh
oadm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default
```

Note that the following command did not work yet in the test:

```sh
# kubectl patch statefulset web -p '{"spec":{"updateStrategy":{"type":"RollingUpdate"}}}'
statefulset "web" not patched
```

Test is done till <code>Staging an Update<code> section. Leave the rest as TODO for the moment.
