# [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

## [Getting started](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/getting-started/)

This is part in our inventory file where we configure docker registry use s3 as storage.

```sh
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_kind=object
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_provider=s3
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_s3_accesskey=<secret>
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_s3_secretkey=<secret>
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_s3_bucket=aoe-svt-test
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_s3_region=us-west-2
openshift_hosted_registry_replicas=1
```
So as a user we need those information to locate a s3 bucket: bucket name (aoe-svt-test) and region (us-west-2). Keys are for authentication.

We can use AWS S3 web console to manipulate buckets and objects (files) in the bucket. As always, we have cli tool for scripting and SDK for programming.
